*If 36 FP here, could Shocker Zombone once, more if Ice Bomb is available
*Tested this, yeah, I would go (Zombone phase starts) Geno Attacks, Mario Attacks, Shocker, Geno Attacks, Mario Attacks (5 Total Attacks) and he dies. I also think Bowser is worth swapping in as long as Geno survives to the Zombone phase and you time his first attack correctly. If he dies after, Bowser can attack on the next 2 turns and cover for the damage before Zombone attacks a 3rd time. If Geno dies early, then just 3 Mario Attacks + a Shocker OR 2 Bowser Attacks should cover the 1800 HP.-

Get Sonic Cymbals (chest after the rotating platforms over lava room)

*If full chain and all attacks timed well, it’s just x3 Jumps and x3 Shockers is good. If you ½ time a jump I think the damage still works out. Slightly more then that, yeah, I’d say just skip the last Shocker and Attack on Turn 4.

*If Mallow gets hit with a status effect by one of the Ring-a-Dings in round 1, have Mario use a Cleansing Juice then on Mario’s following turn do a physical attack instead of Jump then swap in Geno and attack instead of defend **V0oid edit: In general, if time marches on, or you get off the optimal script, you’ll have to play this fight out by ear a little bit. Just remember that getting rid of the Ring-a-Dings should be a priority.

*IceBlue broutht this up and I like it a lot, if you drop early, have Geno Geno Boost himself, then end on SJ’s after Smithy’s 2nd attack. If he doesn’t kill Geno, then you can push 2500 damage before Tank Head phase in Smithy 2. **V0oid edit: Geno needs to not die to the ensuing attack for this to be viable (unless Geno Boost carries over to phase 2 even if the character dies).

SMITHY 2 (8000 HP)
(SJ’s are 270 base, 33 extra damage per on Tank Head):
Star Riders with Geno / Attack / Attack / Attack (should be ~1.9k damage total)
Tank Head phase
Super Jump / Shocker (585) / Croaka Cola
Super Jump / Shocker
***you need 134 Super Jumps over 2 sets, go for 69 twice if you’re a chad.
***swapping Mallow out and back in after Shredder does NOT reset the Troopa Medal boost.
***snowy should do ~350 to Safe Head.
***All physicals if Mage Head shows up, all fire if Chest Head shows up, all despairge if
Safe Head shows up. Yes, this needs A LOT OF work and sciencing lmao.
